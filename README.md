# Unit Price Calculator

This app was build just to get the actual price of the items that I always buy. For instance, if I bought 10 Oreos (who don't love Oreo, right?? hehehe), and all the totals that I shoukd pay is around RM20. So, that means, one Oreo that I bought was around RM1.00. Wow. So cheap eh?? Hahaha..

The other reasons is, not every outlet or shop will give the receipt to us, and it will bring us some headache just to know the actual price. Am I right? So, I hope, this Unit Price Calculator will help you out to get the actual price per item.
